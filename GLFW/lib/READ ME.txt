This project doesn't come with precompiled glfw library files
you should do either:
    Download the latest prebuilt from the GLFW website: https://www.glfw.org/
        You may find that this doesn't work
Or:
    Download the source and compile it using cmake. To do this:
        run cmake in the glfw source folder using cmake -S . -B build/ This generates files inside the subdirectory build
        go into the build folder, and run make then run make install
        This will almost certainly work
